function fixAxes(src,~)
%fixAxes fixes an ugly Matlab bug when resizing a box-panel which holds an
%axis and a legend. This problem occurs even though the axis is inside a
%uicontainer to group all axes elements. And it only occurs for box-panels.
%If the uicontainer, which holds axis and legend, is inside a tab-panel this
%problem does not occur. They had one job ... m(
