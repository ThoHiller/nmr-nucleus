function [signalN,noise] = addNoiseToSignal(signal,mu,sigma)
%addNoiseToSignal adds noise with mean 'mu' and standard deviation 'sigma' to
%a synthetic NMR signal
%
% Syntax:
%       addNoiseToSignal(time,signal,varargin)
%
% Inputs:
%       signal - vector or matrix containing the NMR data
%       mu - mean of the Gaussian noise (generally 0)
%       sigma - standard deviation of the Gaussian noise
%
% Outputs:
%       signalN - NMR signal with noise
%       noise - noise vector/matrix
%
% Example:
%       [sN,noise] = addNoiseToSignal(signal,0,0.01)
%
% Other m-files required:
%       none
%
% Subfunctions:
%       none
%
% MAT-files required:
%       none
